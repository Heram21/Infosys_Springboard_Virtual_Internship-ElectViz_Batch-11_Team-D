## ElectViz: Election Data Visualization for Media

## Overview:
"ElectViz" is a data visualization project designed to help media organizations and analysts understand United States election data beyond the traditional “horse race” narrative.  
The project focuses on explaining "why" outcomes change, not just "who" wins, by transforming complex historical election data into clear, interactive, and journalist-friendly dashboards.

ElectViz bridges the gap between raw election statistics and real-world voter behavior, making democratic processes more accessible and interpretable.

## Project Files:
- Primary Development File  
  Power BI project file containing the complete data model, dashboards, and interactive reports.

- Cleaned Source Dataset  
  Historical US Election dataset (1976–2022) after preprocessing and validation.

- Power Query Logic  
  ETL transformations used to clean, normalize, and structure raw election data.

- DAX Measure Repository  
  Custom DAX measures for metrics such as:
  - Weighted Vote Share %
  - Seats Won by Party
  - Participation trends and thresholds

## Key Features:
- Multivariate Trend Analysis
  Visualizes long-term voting and seat distribution patterns from 1976 to 2022.

- Dynamic Geographic Insights  
  State-wise breakdown of candidate performance and voter participation.

- Special Election Analytics  
  Coverage of fusion tickets and special elections for deeper political context.

- Path to Victory Tracker  
  Calculates seats won and vote share to identify progress toward key thresholds.

- Candidate & Party Benchmarking  
  Comparative analysis of top candidates and party dominance across years.

- Deep-Dive Filtering  
  Interactive slicers for Year, State, and Party to support investigative reporting.

## Tools and Technologies:
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop – End-to-end data modeling and dashboard creation  
- Power Query (M Language) – Data cleaning, transformation, and ETL  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Advanced analytical calculations  
- Geospatial Mapping – Bing Maps integration for state-level analysis  
- Interactive Visuals – AI visuals, slicers, and trend indicators

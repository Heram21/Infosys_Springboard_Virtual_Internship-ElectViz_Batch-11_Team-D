## ElectViz: Election Data Visualization for Media

## Overview:
"ElectViz" is a data visualization project designed to help media organizations and analysts understand United States election data beyond the traditional “horse race” narrative.  
The project focuses on explaining "why" outcomes change, not just "who" wins, by transforming complex historical election data into clear, interactive, and journalist-friendly dashboards.

ElectViz bridges the gap between raw election statistics and real-world voter behavior, making democratic processes more accessible and interpretable.

## Project Files:
- Raw Dataset:
  Historical U.S. House election data (CSV format)
  Processed using Power Query
  Standardized state and party names

- Power BI File (.pbix):
  Contains data model, DAX measures, and dashboards

- Documentation:
  Project report
  Dashboard explanation
  PPT for final submission

## Key Features:
- Multivariate Trend Analysis
  Visualizes long-term voting and seat distribution patterns from 1976 to 2022.

- Dynamic Geographic Insights  
  State-wise breakdown of candidate performance and voter participation.

- Special Election Analytics  
  Coverage of fusion tickets and special elections for deeper political context.

- Path to Victory Tracker  
  Calculates seats won and vote share to identify progress toward key thresholds.

- Candidate & Party Benchmarking  
  Comparative analysis of top candidates and party dominance across years.

- Deep-Dive Filtering  
  Interactive slicers for Year, State, and Party to support investigative reporting.

## Tools and Technologies:
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop – End-to-end data modeling and dashboard creation  
- Power Query (M Language) – Data cleaning, transformation, and ETL  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Advanced analytical calculations  
- Geospatial Mapping – Bing Maps integration for state-level analysis  
- Interactive Visuals – AI visuals, slicers, and trend indicators

## Conclusion
ElectViz transforms complex and large-scale election data into meaningful visual stories through interactive dashboards and structured analytics. By organizing raw datasets into clear charts, maps, and performance indicators, the system simplifies the interpretation of voting patterns, party dominance, regional trends, and winning margins. Instead of manually analyzing spreadsheets, users can quickly explore insights through dynamic filters and visual comparisons, making election data more accessible and understandable.

By providing clarity during chaotic election cycles, the project empowers journalists, analysts, researchers, and the general public to make informed interpretations of democratic outcomes. ElectViz not only enhances transparency but also demonstrates how Business Intelligence tools like Power BI can convert data into actionable insights. Ultimately, the project highlights the importance of data-driven analysis in strengthening awareness and understanding of democratic processes.
